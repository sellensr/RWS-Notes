    "This sequence was created primarily to support MECH 217, Measurement in Mechatronics. It is organized on the asssumption you have a basic programming course, but no familiarity with Python or Jupyter. It is not a full coverage tutorial, and concentrates on skills you need for the course.\n",

    "You can find more background at https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/rwsnotes/\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.X The Basics** of using Jupyter Notebooks to run some Python Code and plot graphs. You will need all of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.X Formatting** text and pictures to explain your code. Yopu will need all of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.X Statistics, Monte Carlo Simulations and Uncertainty.** 3.5 and above are not required for MECH 217, but may be of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.X Sampling and Signal Processing Techniques.** 4.5 and above are not required for MECH 217, but may be of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.X Control Techniques.** 6.5 and above are not required for MECH 217, but may be of interest.\n",
